## Introduction
It is estimated that about 56 million abortions are performed yearly worldwide making it a perennial problem among scholars especially in the field of bio-ethics. While some consider it as a grave evil to be avoided, others see it as an exercise of human right. One major point of disagreement is when human life starts. And until this  controversy is addressed, the debate will  be endless.
In this presentation, we shall discuss the concept of abortion and a case study on abortion.
## Definition
The term abortion is derived from the Latin word aboriri, ‘to perish’. In simple terms, abortion refers to an induced procedure at any point during human pregnancy. 
Abortion could simply be taken to be the termination of pregnancy or the expulsion of the fetus from the uterus before it is viable, that is before it can live outside the uterus, resulting in its death.
